# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Recommendation engines have become a popular solution for online retailers and streaming content providers looking to suggest products and media to users. Also known as recommender systems, these tools filter out less relevant information in order to predict how likely a user is to purchase an item or engage with certain videos or images, and suggest those things to the user. The recommender systems benefit greatly by exploiting the relationships through the expressive power of Graphs.

Property graphs have become a useful way to model, manage, query and analyze much of the connected data found in today’s applications and information systems. They allow you to represent data based on relationships and connectivity, query data by traversing those connections, and analyze data using algorithms that evaluate the strength of the connections, patterns and anomalies in the graph, the importance of elements in the graph, and other factors.

Learn to build a real-time recommendation engine using Oracle Graph on a real-world dataset residing in Oracle Autonomous Database.

Estimated Workshop Time : 2 hours

### About Oracle Database Graph Technologies

**Oracle Database** delivers a high performance and scalable graph data management platform for enterprises. Oracle Graph technologies offer State-of-the art features and functionality required for enterprise grade applications: fine-grained security, high availability, easy manageability, and integration with other data in an application. Oracle’s converged, multi-model database natively supports graphs, spatial, XML, JSON and other types of data.

**Oracle Database Property Graph** supports graph storage, indexing, and search; a powerful in-memory graph server with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; a graph query language and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.
